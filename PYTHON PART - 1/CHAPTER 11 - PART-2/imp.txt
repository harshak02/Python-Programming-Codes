'''if we are creating a base class with constructor and  derived
class without a constructor then pls add a blank constructor in
the base class or create a constructor in the derived clas also
here in c++ we need to create like derived : pubblic XXXX ,public XXXX
but in python we can create the independent constructor in the
derived class if base cls sconstructor should be run then put like
super().__init__()'''

'''for multiple inheritance if we wanted to write the super().
we need to write the BaseClassName().__init__(self,....)'''
