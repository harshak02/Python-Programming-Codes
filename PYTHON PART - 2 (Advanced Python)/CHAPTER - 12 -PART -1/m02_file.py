import m01_file#here it executes

m01_file.greet("Harry")
m01_file.printData2()#atlast one bye will print
#and again whole code wont runs coz aldredy runs

'''The result is that :
first the code runs after the functions derivations 
for example here it runs from the name = input to
it runs the whole code and gives the first prefernce to the 
befor file and then the import written file runs(runs at last
after whole code which is imported from before one)
